# My Dotfiles

A set of dotfiles inspired by those of mathiasbynens, paulirish, chrishunt, [vasiliy.yorkin](https://github.com/vyorkin-personal/d), and garybernhardt.


Notes:

* I usually clone this right into my home directory and add new files using `git add -f`
* When using iTerm2, enable "Applications in terminal may access system clipboard"
* Map caps lock to esc
